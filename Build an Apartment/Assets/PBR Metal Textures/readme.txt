--------------------------------------------------
Asset:

The asset consists of 32 gloss maps with the appearance of different scratched metal surfaces. There's a corresponding material for each of the gloss map with a pre-rendered spec+gloss alpha.

In addition there are additional normal maps, custom models and multiple demo scenes showcasing some of the textures.

--------------------------------------------------
Texture Specs:

All textures included are PNGs with a resolution of 2048x2048, losslessly compressed without artifacts, so that they can be suitable to use as masks or brushes when producing your own textures.

--------------------------------------------------
Scenes:

In order for the demo scenes to match the screenshots, be sure to have your project's color space set to Linear in PlayerSettings.
